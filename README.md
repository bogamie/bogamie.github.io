# When Commit your code...

## Step 1

&nbsp;&nbsp;Open git bash and type `git status` to check which files will be committed.
```
git status
```

<br>

## Step 2

&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to commit all changed files, use `git add .`. However, if you only want to add specific files, use `git add (file name)`.

```
git add .
```

or 

```
git add lib/main.dart
```

<br>

## Step 3

&nbsp;&nbsp;Write the revised contents. This is the most important step in the entire process. Use concise and clear expressions to make it easier to understand each time you read them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;First put `git commit` and press enter. This will open "COMMIT_EDITMSG" file, where you can type your commit messages.

```
git commit
```

<br>

Here are several rules to write commit messages.

1. Seperate the title and body with a blank line.
2. Limit the title to 50 characters or less.
3. Begin the title with a capital letter.
4. Don't include '.' at the end of the title.
5. Use imperative sentence for the title and avoid using the past tense.
6. Limit each line of the body to 72 characters.
7. Focus on what and why rather than how when explaining.
8. Headers are compulsory, but bodies and footers are optinal.

```
(Type): (Title) // Header

(Content) // Body

(Footer) // Footer
```

#### Example

```
Refactor: Separate AppBar as a class

Create another dart file with AppBar class to make reusable appbar.
From now on, the reuse_element file will contain frequently used elements.
```

## Step 4

&nbsp;&nbsp;When you finished writing messages, close editor screen and push them.
```
git push
```
<br>

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0
```
