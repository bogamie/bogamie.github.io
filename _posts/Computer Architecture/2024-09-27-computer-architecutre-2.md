# 2.1 Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp; The words of a computer's language are called *instructions*, and its vocabulary is called an **instruction sets**[^1]. In this chapter, you will see the instruction set of a real computer, both in the form written by people and in the form read by the computer.

<div class="bg"></div>

# 2.2 Operations of the Computer Hardware

&nbsp;&nbsp; Every computer must be able to perform arithmetic. The MIPS assembly language notation

```nasm
add a, b, c
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; instructs a computer to add the two variables `b` and `c` and to put their sum in `a`.

&nbsp;&nbsp; This notation is rigid in that each MIPS arithmetic instruction performs only one operation and must have exactly three variables. For example, suppose we want place the sum of four variables `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` into vairiable `a`.

&nbsp;&nbsp; The following sequence of instructions adds the four variables:

```nasm
add a, b, c     # The sum of b and c is placed in a
add a, a, d     # The sum of b, c and d is now in a
add a, a, e     # The sum of b, c, d and e is now in a
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, it takes three instructions to sum the four variables.

&nbsp;&nbsp; The natural number of operands for an operation like addition is three: the two numbers being added together and a place to put the sum. Requiring every instruction to have exactly three operands, no more and no less, conforms to the philosophy of keeping the hardware simple: hardware for a variable number of operands is more complicated than hardware for a fixed number. This situation illustrates the first of three underlying of hardware design:

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.25rem"><em>Design Principle 1: <strong>Simplicity favors regularity.</strong></em></p>

<div class="bg"></div>

# 2.3 Operands of the Computer Hardware

&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike programs in high-level languages, the operands of arithmetic instructions are restricted; they must be from a limited number of special locations built directly in hardware called *registers*. Registers are primitives used in hardware design that are also visible to the programmer when the computer is completed, so you can think of registers as the bricks of computer construction. The size of a register in the MIPS architecture is 32 bits; groups of 32 bits occur so frequently that they are given the name **word**[^2] in the MIPS architecture.

&nbsp;&nbsp; The three operands of MIPS arithmetic instructions must each be chosen from one of the 32 32-bit registers. The reason for the limit of 32 registers may be found in the second of our three underlying design principles of hardware technology:

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.25rem"><em>Design Principle 2: <strong>Smaller is faster.</strong></em></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; A very large number of registers may increase the clock cycle time simply because it takes electronic signals longer when they must travel farther. Guidlines such as "smaller is faster" are not absolutes; 31 registers may not be faster than 32.

&nbsp;&nbsp; The MIPS convention is to use two-character names following a dollar sign to represent a register. [Section 2.8](/posts/2-instructions-language-of-the-computer#28-supporting-procedures-in-computer-hardware) will explain the reasons behind these names. For now, we will use `$s0`, `$s1`, ... for registers that correspond to variables in C and Java programs and `$t0`, `$t1`, ... for temporary registers needed to compile the program into MIPS instructions.

## a. Memory Operands

&nbsp;&nbsp; The processor can keep only a small amount of data in registers, but computer memory contains billions of data elements. Hence, data structures (arrays and structures) are kept in memory.

&nbsp;&nbsp; The arithmetic operations occur only on registers in MIPS instructions; thus, MIPS must include instructions that transfer data between memory and registers. Such instructions are called **data transfer instructions**[^3]. To access a word in memory, the instruction must supply the memory **address**[^4].

&nbsp;&nbsp; The data transfer instruction that copies data from memory to register is traditionally called *load*. The format of the load instruction is the name of the operation followed by the register to be loaded, then a constant and register used to access memory. The sum of the constant portionof the instruction and the contents of the second register forms the memory address. The actual MIPS name for this instruction is ***lw***, standing for ***load word***.

> &nbsp;&nbsp Let's assume that `A` is an array of 100 words and that the compiler has associated the variables `g` and `h` with the registers `$s1` and `$s2` as before. Let's also assume that the starting address, or *base address*, of the array is in `$3`. Compile this C assignment statement:

> 
> &nbsp;&nbsp; Although there is a single operation in this assignment statement, one of the operands is in memory, so we must first transfer <code>A[8]</code> to a register. The address of this array element is the sum of the base of the array <code>A</code>, found in register <code>$s3</code>, plus the number to select element 8. The data should be placed in a temporary register for use in the next instruction. The first compiled instruction is

>

>
> &nbsp;&nbsp; The constant in a data transfer instruction (8) is called the <em>offset</em>, and the register added to form the address (<code>$s3</code>) is called the <em>base register</em>.

> &nbsp;&nbsp; In MIPS, words must start at addresses that are multiples of 4. This requirement is called and **alignment restriction**, and many architectures have it.

<div class="bg"></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp; The instruction complementary to load is traditionally called ***store***; it copies data from a register to memory. The format of a store is similar to that of a load: the name of the operation, followed by the register to be stored, then offset to select the array element, and finally the base register. The actual MIPS name is ***sw***, standing for ***store word***.

> &nbsp;&nbsp; Many programs have more variable than computers have registers. Consequently, the compiler tries to keep the most frequently used variables in registers and places the rest in memory, using load and stores to move variables between registers and memory. The process of putting less commonly used variables (or those needed later) into memory is called ***spilling*** registers.
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp; To achieve highest performance and conserve energy, an instruction set architecture must have a sufficient number of registers, and compilers must use registers effectively.

## b. Constant or Immediate Operands

&nbsp;&nbsp; Many times a program will use a constant in an operation—for example, incrementing an index to point to the next element of an array. Using only the instructions we have seen so far, we would have to load a constant from memory to use one. For example, to add the constant 4 to register `$s3`, we could use the code

```asm
lw $t0, AddrConstant4($s1)    # $t0 = constant 4
add $s3, $s3, $t0             # $s3 = $s3 + $t0 ($t0 == 4)
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; assuming that `$s1 + AddrConstant4` is the memory address of the constant 4.

&nbsp;&nbsp; An alternative that avoids the load instruction is to offer versions of the arithmetic instructions in which one operand is a constant. This quick add instruction with one constant operand is called ***add immediate*** or ***addi***. To add 4 to register `$s3`, we just write

```asm
addi $s3, $s3, 4    # $s3 = $s3 + 4
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; Constant operands occur frequently, and by including constants inside arithmetic instructions, operations are much faster and useless energy than if constants were loaded from memory.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d564b128-6384-454a-a8fd-182afbe5ebcb#right" alt="image" height="5%" width="5%">*&nbsp;&nbsp; The constant zero has another role, which is to simplify the instruction set by offering useful variations. For example, the move operation is just an add instruction where on operand is zero. Hence, MIPS dedicates a register `$zero` to be hard-wired to the value zero. Using frequency to justify the inclusions of constants is another example of the great idea of making the **common case fast**.*

# 2.4 Signed and Unsigned Numbers

&nbsp;&nbsp; Numbers are kept in computer hardware as a series of high and low electronic signals, and so they are considered base 2 numbers. (Just as base 10 numbers are called *decimal* numbers, base 2 numbers are called *binary* numbers.)

&nbsp;&nbsp; A single digit of a binary number is thus the "atom" of computing, since all information is composed of **binary digits**[^5] or ***bits***. This fundamental building block can be one of two values, which can be thought of as several alternatives: high and low, on or off, true or false, or 1 or 0.

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce19a559-8ba7-4d92-8cf4-3c53909f1a0f#center" alt="image" height="95%" width="95%">

&nbsp;&nbsp; Since words are drawn vertically as well as horizontally, leftmost and rightmost may be unclear. Hence, the phrase **least significant bit** is used to refer to the right-most bit (bit 0 above) and **most significant bit** to the leftmost bit (bit 31).

&nbsp;&nbsp; The MIPS word is 32 bits long, so it can represent $2^{32}$ different 32-bit patterns. It is natural to let these combinations represent the numbers from 0 to 2<sup>32</sup>-1 (4,294,967,295<sub>10</sub>):

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a44c2ee0-8616-4772-81bc-ecbb94852bac#center" alt="image" height="95%" width="95%">

&nbsp;&nbsp; These positive numbers are called **unsigned numbers**.

<div class="bg"></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Computer programs calculate both positive and negative numbers, so we need a representation that distinguishes the positive from the negative. The most obvious solution is to add a separate sign, which conveniently can be represented in a single bit; the name for this representation is ***sign and magnitude***.

&nbsp;&nbsp; However, sign and magnitude representation has several shortcomings. First, it's not obvious where to put the sign bit. Second, adders for sign and magnitude may need an extra step to set the sign because we can't know in advance what the proper sign will be. Finally, a seperate sign bit means that sign and magnitude has both a positive and a negative zero, which can lead to problems for inattentive programmers. As a result of these shortcomings, sign and magnitude representation was soon abandoned.

&nbsp;&nbsp; The final solution was to pick the representation that made the hardware simple: leading 0s mean positive, and leading 1s mean negative. This convention for representing signed binary numbers is called ***two's complement*** representation:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/930872cb-3082-440c-aec4-f276b2c73be3#center" alt="image" height="95%" width="95%">

&nbsp;&nbsp; The positive half of the numbers, from 0 to 2,147,483,647<sub>10</sub> (2<sup>31</sup>-1), use the same representation as before. The following bit pattern (1000 ... 0000<sub>2</sub>) represents the most negative number -2,147,483,648<sub>10</sub> (-2<sup>31</sup>). It is followed by a declining set of negative numbers: -2,147,483,647<sub>10</sub> (1000 ... 0001<sub>2</sub>) down to -1<sub>10</sub> (1111 ... 1111<sub>2</sub>).

&nbsp;&nbsp; Two's complement representation has the advantage that all negative numbers have a 1 in the most significant bit. This bit is often called the ***sign bit***. By recognizing the role of the sign bit, we can represent positive and negative 32-bit numbers in terms of the bit value times a power of 2:

$$
(x31 \times -2^{31}) + (x30 \times 2^{30}) + \cdots + (x1 \times 2^1) + (x0 \times 2^0)
$$

> </details>

<div class="bg"></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Overflow occurs when the leftmost retained bit of the binary bit pattern is not the same as the infinite number of digits to the left (the sign bit is incorrect): a 0 on the left of the bit pattern when the number is negative or a 1 when the number is positive.

> **Hardware/Software Interface**
> 
> &nbsp;&nbsp; The *function* of signed load is to copy the sign repeatedly to fill the rest of the register—called *sign extension*—but its *purpose* is to place a correct representation of the number within that register. Unsigned loads simply fill with 0s to the left of the data, since the number represented by the bit pattern is unsigned.
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp; When loading a 32-bit word into a 32-bit register, the point is moot; signed and unsigned are identical. MIPS does offer two flavors of byte loads: ***load byte*** (`lb`) treats the byte as a signed number and thus sign-extends to fill the 24 left-most bits of the register, while ***load byte unsigned*** (`lbu`) works with unsigned integers. Since C programs almost always use bytes to represent characters, `lbu` is used practically exclusively for byte loads.

<div class="bg"></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's examine two useful shorcuts when working with two's complement numbers. The first shortcut is a quick way to negate a two's complement binary number. Simple invert every 0 to 1 and every 1 to 0, then add one to result. This shortcut is based on the observation that the sum of a number and its inverted representation must be 111 ... 111<sub>2</sub>, which represents -1.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Our next shortcut tells us how to convert a binary number represented in *n* bits to a number represented with more than *n* bits. To add a 16-bit register to a 32-bit register, the computer must convert that 16-bit number to its 32-bit equivalent. The shortcut is to take the most significant bit from the smaller quantity—**the sign bit**—and replicate it to fill the new bits of the larger quantity. The old nonsign bits are simply copied into the right portion of the new word. This shortcut is called ***sign extension***.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Since registers are referred to by almost all instructions, there must be a convention to map register names into numbers. In MIPS assembly language, registers `$s0` to `$s7` map onto registers 16 to 23, and registers `$t0` to `$t7` map onto registers 8 to 15. Hence, `$s0` means register 16, `$s1` means register 17, `$s2` means register 18,..., `$t0` means register 8, `$t1` means register 9, and so on.

> &nbsp;&nbsp; Each of these segments of an instruction is called a <em><strong>field</strong></em>. The first and last fields (containing 0 and 32 in this case) in combination tell the MIPS computer that this instruction performs addition. The second field gives the number of the register that is the first source operand of the addition operation (17 = <code>$s1</code>), and the third field gives the other source operand (18 = <code>$s2</code>). The fourth field contains the number of the register that is to receive the sum (8 = <code>$t0</code>). The fifth field is unused in this instruction, so it is set to 0. Thus, this instruction adds register <code>$s1</code> to register <code>$s2</code> and places the sum in register <code>$t0</code>. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; This layout of the instruction is called the **instruction format**[^6]. As you can see from counting the number of bits, this MIPS instruction takes exactly 32 bits—the same size as a data word.

&nbsp;&nbsp; To distinguish it from assembly language, we call the numberic version of instructions **machine language**[^7] and a sequence of such instructions *machine code*.

<div class="bg"></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Since almost all computer data sizes are multiples of 4, **hexadecimal**[^8] (base 16) numbers are popular. Since base 16 is a power of 2, we can convert by replacing each group of four binary digits by a single hexadecimal digit, and vice versa.

## a. MIPS Fields

&nbsp;&nbsp; MIPS fields are given names to make them easier to discuss:

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7742339a-6abd-4e92-b39b-52aae40e7da5#center" alt="image" height="95%" width="95%">

&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is the meaning of each name of the fields in MIPS instructions:

* ***op***: Basic operation of the instruction, traditionally called the **opcode**[^9].
* ***rs***: The first register source operand.
* ***rt***: The second register source operand.
* ***rd***: The register destination operand. It gets the result of the operation.
* ***shamt***: Shift amount. A constant value for shift instructions.
* ***funct***: Function. This field, often called the ***function code***, selects the specific variant of the operation in the op field.

<div class="bg"></div>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.25rem"><em>Design Principle 3: <strong>Good design demands good compormises.</strong></em></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; The compromise chosen by the MIPS designers is to keep all instructions the same length, thereby requiring different kinds of instruction formats for different kinds of instructions. For example, the format above is called ***R-type*** (for register) or ***R-format***. A second type of instruction format is called ***I-type*** (for immediate) or ***I-format*** and is used by the immediate and data transfer instructions. The fields of I-format are

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74470109-f013-4ed6-a279-3e44684e130e#center" alt="image" height="95%" width="95%">

&nbsp;&nbsp; The 16-bit address means a load word instruction can load any word within a region of ±2<sup>15</sup> or 32,768 bytes (±2<sup>13</sup> or 8192 words) of the address in the base register `rs`. Similarily, add immediate is limited to constants no larger than ±2<sup>15</sup>.

<div class="bg"></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's look at the load word instruction:

```text
lw $t0, 32($s3)     # Temporary reg $t0 gets A[8]
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, 19 (for `$s3`) is placed in the `rs` field, 8 (for `$t0`) is placed in the `rt` field, and 32 is placed in the address field. In a load word instruction, the `rt` field specifies the ***destination*** register, which receives the result of the load.

<div class="bg"></div>

# 2.6 Logical Operations

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc90d13c-fd41-438e-a7a9-5da4166c73ea#center" alt="image" height="80%" width="80%">

&nbsp;&nbsp; The first class of such operations is called ***shifts***. They move all the bits in a word to the left or right,filling the emptied bits with 0s. For example, if register `$s0` contained

```text
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1001 = 9
```

and the instruction to shift left by 4 was executed, the new value would be:

```text
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1001 0000 = 144
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; The dual of a shift left is a shift right. The actual name of the two MIPS shift instructions are called ***shift left logical*** (sll) and ***shift right logical*** (srl). The following instruction performs the operation above, assuming that the original vaalue was in register `$s0` and the result should go in register `$t2`:

```text
sll $t2, $s0, 4    # reg $r2 = reg $s0 << 4 bits
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; Used in shift instructions, it stands for ***shift amount***. Hence, the machine language version of the instruction above is

<img class="lazy" data-src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eafc0db0-c44e-4f1e-a073-122882a071b0#center" alt="image" height="80%" width="80%">

&nbsp;&nbsp; The encoding of `sll` is 0 in both the `op` and `funct` fields, `rd` contains 10 (register `$t2`), `rt` contains 16 (register `$s0`), and `shamt` contains 4. The `rs` field is unused and thus is set to 0.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Shift left logical provides a bonus benefit. Shifting left by *i* bits gives the same result as multiplying by 2<sup>*i*</sup>. For example, the above `sll` shifts by 4, which gives the same result as multiplying by 2<sup>4</sup> or 16.

<div class="bg"></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Another useful operation that isolates fields is **AND**. AND is bit-by-bit operation that leaves a 1 in the result only if both bits of the operands are 1. For example, if register `$t2` contains

```text
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1101 1100 0000
```

and register `$t1` contains

```text
0000 0000 0000 0000 0011 1100 0000 0000
```

then, after executing the MIPS instruction

```text
and $t0, $t1, $t2    # reg $t0 = $t1 & $t2
```

the value if register `$t0` would be

```text
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1101 1100 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000 0011 1100 0000 0000
---------------------------------------
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1100 0000 0000
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, AND can apply a bit pattern to a set of bits to force 0s where there is a 0 in the bit pattern. Such a bit pattern in conjunction with AND is called a ***mask***, since the mask "conceals" some bits.

<div class="bg"></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp; **OR** is a bit-by-bit operation that places a 1 in the result if *either* operand bit is a 1. For example

```text
or $t0, $t1, $t2    # reg $t0 = $t1 | $t2
```

then the value of register `$t0` would be

```text
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1101 1100 0000 
0000 0000 0000 0000 0011 1100 0000 0000
---------------------------------------
0000 0000 0000 0000 0011 1101 1100 0000
```

<div class="bg"></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp; The final logical operation is a contrarian. **NOT** takes one operand and places a 1 in the result if one operand bit is a 0, and vice versa. 

&nbsp;&nbsp; The MIPS instruction for NOT is called ***NOR*** (NOT OR). It calculates a 1 only if there is a 0 in *both* operands. If one operand is zero, then it is equivalent to NOT: 

```text
A NOR 0 = NOT (A OR 0) = NOT A
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; If the register `$t1` is unchanged from the preceding example and register `$t3` has the value 0, the result of the MIPS instruction

```text
nor $t0, $t1, $t3    # reg $t0 = ~($t1 | $t3)
```

is this value in register `$t0`:

```text
1111 1111 1111 1111 1100 0011 1111 1111
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; Constants are useful in AND and OR logical operations as well as in arithmetic operations, so MIPS also provides the instructions ***and immediate*** (andi) and ***or immediate*** (ori). Constants are rare for NOR, since its main use is to invert the bits of a single operand; thus, the MIPS instruction set architecture has no immediate version.

<div class="bg"></div>

# 2.7 Instructions for Making Decisions

## a. Conditional Operations

&nbsp;&nbsp; MIPS assembly language includes two decision-making instructions, similar to an *if* statement with a *go to*. The first instruction is

```text
beq register1, register2, L1
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; This instruction means go to the statement labeled `L1` if the value in `register1` equals the value in `register2`. The mnemonic `beq` stands for ***branch if equal***. The second instruction is

```text
bne register1, register2, L1
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; It means go to the statement labeled `L1` if the value in `register1` does ***not*** equal the value in `register2`. The mnemonic `bne` stands for ***branch if not equal***. These two instructions are called ***conditional branches***[^10].

> &nbsp;&nbsp; The first expression compares for equality, so it would seem that we would want the branch if registers are equal instruction (beq). In general, the code will be more efficient if we test for the opposite condition to branch over the codethat performs the subsequent <em>then</em> part of the <em>if</em> and so we use the branch if registers are <em>not</em> equal instruction (bne):

> We now need to go to the end of the <em>if</em> statement. This example introduces another kind of branch, often called an <strong><em>unconditional branch</em></strong>. This instruction says that the processor always follows the branch. To distinguish between conditional and unconditional branches, the MIPS name for this type of instruction is <strong><em>jump</em></strong>, abbreviated <code>j</code>.

## b. Loops

&nbsp;&nbsp; Decisions are important both for choosing between two alternatives—found in if statements—and for iterating a computation—found in loops. The same assembly instructions are the building blocks for both cases.

> **Compiling a *while* Loop in C**
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp; Here is a traditional loop in C:

>
> <details><summary><strong>Answer</strong></summary>
> 
> &nbsp;&nbsp; The first step is to load <code>save[i]</code> into a temporary register. Before we can load <code>save[i]</code> into a temporary register, we need to have its address. Before we can add <code>i</code> to the base of array <code>save</code> to form the address, we must multiply the index <code>i</code> by 4 due to form the addressing. We can use shift left logical, since shifting left by 2 bits multiplies by 2<sup>2</sup> or 4. We need to add the label <code>Loop</code> to it so that we can branch back to that instruction at the end of the loop:

## c. For Loops

```text
slt $d, $s, $t      # $d = ($s < $t)
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; The instruction `slt` stands for ***set on less than***. It compares two registers and sets a third register to 1 if the first is less than the second; otherwise, it is set to 0.

```text
slti $t, $s, i      # $t = ($s < SE(i))
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; Constant operands are popular in comparisons, so there is an immediate version of the set on less than instruction.

> **Hardware/Software Interface**
> 
> &nbsp;&nbsp; MIPS compilers use the `slt`, `slti`, `beq`, `bne`, and the fixed value of 0 (`$zero`) to create all relative conditions: equal, not equal, less than, less than or equal, greater than, and greater than or equal.

The value in register <code>$s1</code> represents 1<sub>10</sub> in either case. Then register <code>$t0</code> has the value 1, since -1 < 1, and register <code>$t1</code> has the value 0, because 4,294,967,295 > 1.

# 2.8 Supporting Procedures in Computer Hardware

## a. Procedures and Procedure Calls

&nbsp;&nbsp; In the execution of a procedure[^11], the program must follow these six steps:

<ol style="margin-left: 0.5rem;">
    <li>Put parameters in a place where the procedure can access them.</li>
    <li>Transfer control to the procedure.</li>
    <li>Acquire the storage resources needed for the procedure.</li>
    <li>Perform the desired task.</li>
    <li>Put the result value in a place where the calling program can access it.</li>
    <li>Return control to the point of origin, since a procedure can be called from several points in a program.</li>
</ol>

<div class="bg"></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp; The registers are the fastest place to hold data in a computer, so we want to use them as possible. MIPS software follows the following convention for procedure calling in allocating its 32 registers:

<ol style="margin-left: 0.5rem;">
    <li><code>$a0</code> - <code>$a3</code>: four argument registers in which to pass parameters</li>
    <li><code>$v0</code> - <code>$v1</code>: two value registers in which to return values</li>
    <li><code>$ra</code>: one return address register to return to the point of origin</li>
</ol>

<div class="bg"></div>
<div class="bg"></div>

```text
jal label           # $31 = pc; pc += i << 2
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; The ***jump-and-link*** instruction (`jal`) is used to call a procedure. It jumps to an address and simultaneously saves the address of the following instruction in register `$ra`.

&nbsp;&nbsp; The *link* portion of the name means that an address or link is formed that points to the calling site to allow the procedure to return to the proper address. This "link", stored in register `$ra` (register 31), is called the **return address**[^12]. The return address is needed because the same procedure could be called from several parts of the program.

<div class="bg"></div>

```text
jr $s              # pc = $s (or $ra)
```

&nbsp;&nbsp; The ***jump register*** instruction (`jr`) jumps to the address stored in register `$ra`—which is just what we want. Thus, the calling program, or **caller**[^13]m puts the parameter values in `$a0`-`$a3` and uses `jal label` to jump to procedure `label` (sometimes named the **callee**[^14]). The `callee` then performs the calculations, places the result in `$v0` and `$v1`, and returns control to the caller using `jr $s`.

<div class="bg"></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Implicit in the stored-program idea is the need to have a register to hold the address of the current instruction being executed. This register is called the **program counter**, abreviated `pc` in the MIPS architecture, although a more sensible name would have benn ***instruction address register***. The `jal` instruction actually saves PC + 4 in register `$ra` to link to the following instruction to set up the procedure return.

<div class="bg"></div>

## b. Using More Registers

&nbsp;&nbsp; The ideal data structure for spilling registers is a **stack**[^15]—a last-in-first-out queue. The **stack pointer**[^16] is adjusted by one word for each register that is saved or restored. MIPS software reserves register 29 for the stack pointer, named `$sp`. Stacks have their own buzzwords for transferring data to and from the stack: placing data onto the stack is called a **push**[^17], and removing data from the stack is called a **pop**[^18].

&nbsp;&nbsp; The stacks "grow" from higher addresses to lower addresses. This convention means that you push values onto the stack by subtracting from the stack pointer. Adding to the stack pointer shrinks the stack, thereby popping values off the stack.

<div class="bg"></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp; MIPS software separates 18 of the registers into two groups:

<ol style="margin-left: 0.5rem;">
    <li><code>$t0</code> - <code>$t9</code>: temporary registers that are *not* preserved by the callee (called procedure) on a procedure call</li>
    <li><code>$s0</code> - <code>$s7</code>: saved registers that must be preserved on a procedure call (if used, the callee saves and restore them)</li>
</ol>

&nbsp;&nbsp; This simple convention reduces register spilling. In the example above, since the caller does not expect registers `$t0` and `$t1` to be preserved across a procedure call, we can drop two stores and two loads from the code. We still must save and restore `$s0`, since the callee must assume that the caller needs its value.

```text
leaf_example:
    addi $sp, $sp, -4       # adjust stack to make room for 1 items
    sw   $s0, 0($sp)        # save register $s0 for use afterwards

    add  $t0, $a0, $a1      # register $t0 contains g + h
    add  $t1, $a2, $a3      # register $t1 contains i + j
    sub  $s0, $t0, $t1      # f = (g + h) - (i + j)

    add  $v0, $s0, $zero    # return f

    lw   $s0, 0($sp)        # restore register $s0 for caller
    addi $sp, $sp, 4        # adjust stack to delete 1 items

    jr   $ra                # jump back to calling routine
